#run this command
sh sc1v1.sh 'url'
it will create folder in products, there you can see details
allprices.txt will be recorded with all product in single file

i am changing one file areal.sh to areal.shor04june
this areal.sh was with while loop, but on restart while loop was getting killed, so added in crontab or script to execute

when you are running bulk, you might need to change to old name
